I have attached two items to this email. gamet.h is a C header
file that contains some definitions and structures. 
mockUp is some pseudo code that indicates the values
the structures would have using specific examples.

In file gamet.h the structures were setup to emulate how 
I believe a gamet message is structured. 
A gamet message can contain multiple element types,
e.g., SIG CLD, ICE, TURB etc. Each element type that is listed 
will contain at least one, but can contain multiple "areas" and
the associated description of the phenomenon of the element type.
Therefore, each gamet has one "fir", an issuance hour and day and
an array of element structures.  The element structure contains
an array of area structures and the type of the element.
Finally, the area struct contains the VOR String describing the
area, a description of the phenomenon, e.g. "MOD RIME 
ICGIC 090/FL180" and an array indidating the snapshot forecasts
for 0 hr, +3 hr. and +6 hr.

The second attachment, mockUp fills the above structures using
the SIG CLD (CIG), SIG CLD (TUC) and ICE examples from the GFA
presentation slides from September 2003. These examples are on
pages 30, 31 and 32.

I have noted some questions in the above files but will also
note them here.

1) Is there a maximum number of areas that can be included for
each element type within the gamet? I have a define of 8, in
the header file.

2) In the mentioned examples SIG CLD (CIG) and SIG CLD (TCU) are
presented separately. Would they be passed that way, or would
they be indicated at SIG CLD. I notice that on page 41 of the
presentation, "EXAMPLE: KZLC GAMET SECN 1" both examples are
placed in "SIG CLD" .

3) Relating somewhat to #2, would an element appear more than 
once in a message, e.g., multiple instances of TURB, or would
all TURB areas be within one TURB element.

Finally, if I have made incorrect assumptions or if you have
any questions please let me know. My phone number is
