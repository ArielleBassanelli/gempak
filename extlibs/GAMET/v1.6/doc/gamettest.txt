Leslie,

I have some notes and comments on the GAMET processing...

1. While again reviewing the presentation from the AWC/FAA, I found that
there are element types that you did not include, and some that might
need to be deleted.
- MVIS and LLWS need to be added to the list of valid element types.
- WIND/T, MNM QNH and SEA might need to be removed. There is a notation
that these types are not used in the US. The notation also says that
they will probably never be needed. We could leave them in the list, and
just not use them. I don't have a strong feeling on this.

2. In addition to PSYS and FZLVL, the element type VA requires special
processing. The only information is the name of the volcano, lat/lon
pair and a comment on the eruption.

3. There is a "NIL" value when data for a particular element is not
provided. For example:
            ICE: NIL
There is no area information. I tried to set the area attributes to
"NIL" and left everything else blank in the test program, and got:
            ICE: NIL BOUNDED BY
We need to decide how to deal with NIL reports. One option is that I
could put NIL in the attributes and if you see that in your processing,
then do not add "BOUNDED BY".

4. We need to decide on how to handle "SIGMET APPLICABLE:". The data
value for this item is only a sigmet id name and number, e.g., "FOXTROT
1". It could be a separate data element, with special processing, that
only has an attribute value.

5. PSYS, MVIS, FZLVL and VA are all in "SECN II". I think that you could
write "SECN II" to the output just before processing PSYS.

6. Very minor: while compiling gametTest.c, I got a warning that some
functions were not recognized. I found that you need to include
<stdlib.h>, since you added calls to malloc.

I have attached 2 test files. The first is the example from the
presentation for all data types. The second has the ICE type set to NIL.

Thanks for all of your work,

Scott
